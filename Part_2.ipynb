    "Ok, I'm not going to lie, I didn't know how to do the 2nd part. I started it at 10:00 pm, and that's my fault. Granted, I would send you an email about this, but I don't think it would get to you in time. Anyways, all I was able was add these three routes to the app\\views\\_init__.py file. I have no idea if they work, because I have no idea how to actual run the server on flask or docker. Also, I have no idea how to use json. So, I know it doesn't work, but at least I tried. "
